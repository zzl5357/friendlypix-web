By using the Service, you expressly relieve FriendlyPix from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website. <br>
              <br>
              C.Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit. <br>

              <br>
              4. General Use of the Service—Permissions and Restrictions <br>
              FriendlyPix hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that: <br>

              <br>
              C.You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the FriendlyPix servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FriendlyPix grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. FriendlyPix reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.

              B.Content is provided to you AS IS. You may access Content for your information and personal use solely as intended through the provided functionality of the Service and as permitted under these Terms of Service. You shall not download any Content unless you see a “download” or similar link displayed by FriendlyPix on the Service for that Content. You shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any Content for any other purposes without the prior written consent of FriendlyPix or the respective licensors of the Content. <br>
              <br>
              C.You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Service or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the Content therein. <br>
              <br>
              D.You understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to Content from a variety of sources, and that FriendlyPix is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Content. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against FriendlyPix with respect thereto, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, agree to indemnify and hold harmless FriendlyPix, its owners, operators, affiliates, licensors, and licensees to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the Service. <br>
              <br>
              6. Your Content and Conduct <br>
              <br>
              A.As a FriendlyPix account holder you may submit Content to the Service, including photos and user comments. You understand that FriendlyPix does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any Content you submit. <br>
              <br>

You also hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms of Service. The above licenses granted by you in photo Content you submit to the Service terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your photos from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that FriendlyPix may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your photos that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in user comments you submit are perpetual and irrevocable. <br>
              <br>
              D.You further agree that Content you submit to the Service will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant FriendlyPix all of the license rights granted herein. <br>
              FriendlyPix does not endorse any Content submitted to the Service by any user or other licensor, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and FriendlyPix expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with Content.

              <br>

              B.FriendlyPix reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. FriendlyPix may at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such material in violation of these Terms of Service. <br>
              <br>
              8. Digital Millennium Copyright Act <br>
              A.If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail): <br>
              - A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; <br>
              - Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; <br>
              - Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material; <br>
              - Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail; <br>
              - A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and <br>
              A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. <br>
              You may direct copyright infringement notifications to email: friendlypix-team@google.com. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid. <br>
              <br>
              B.Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent: <br>
              - Your physical or electronic signature; <br>
              - Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled; <br>
              - A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and <br>
              - Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. <br>
              <br>
              If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, FriendlyPix may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at FriendlyPix's sole discretion. <br>
              <br>
              9. Warranty Disclaimer <br>
              YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION. <br>
              <br>

              <br>

              You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. In any case, you affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use the Service. There are lots of other great web sites for you. Talk to your parents about what sites are appropriate for you. <br>
              <br>

If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and FriendlyPix's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. FriendlyPix reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. Your use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms.
